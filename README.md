## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides an interactive choropleth map and comprehensive analysis of Wisconsin's political realignment over 13 presidential election cycles (2000-2024). The visualization reveals how counties shifted between Democratic and Republican support, highlighting key regional patterns like the suburban WOW counties moderating, the Fox Valley BOW counties flipping Republican, and the Driftless Area's dramatic 40+ point swings.

### Key Features

- **Interactive County-Level Visualization**: Click any of Wisconsin's 72 counties to see detailed vote breakdowns across all years
- **Temporal Analysis**: Year-by-year slider to track political shifts over 24 years
- **Comprehensive Research Findings**: Curated narratives on Milwaukee County, WOW suburbs, Dane County, BOW industrial counties, and the Driftless Area
- **Accurate Margin Calculations**: Includes third-party votes in all margin calculations for precision matching between map and data
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional sidebar with collapsible research findings and demographic context

## 📊 Data Methodology

### Data Sources
- **2000-2022**: [OpenElections Wisconsin](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-wi) ward-level CSV files
- **2024**: Wisconsin Elections Commission county-level PDF reports (manually extracted)
- **Geographic Data**: US Census Bureau TIGER/Line shapefiles (2020)

### Calculation Methodology

**Critical**: All margin percentages include third-party votes in the total vote denominator:

```
Margin % = (Rep Votes - Dem Votes) / Total Votes * 100
```

Where `Total Votes = Dem Votes + Rep Votes + Other Votes`

This approach:
- ✅ Matches what voters see on the interactive map
- ✅ Provides more accurate representation of voter behavior
- ✅ Accounts for the impact of third-party candidates (especially significant in 2000, 2016)
- ✅ Consistent with Indiana realignment project methodology

**Example** (Waukesha County 2024):
- Republican: 162,768 votes
- Democrat: 108,478 votes
- Other: 4,541 votes
- Total: 275,787 votes
- Margin: R+19.69% (not R+20.02% if calculated on two-party vote)

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Extract** → PDF/CSV files parsed using `tabula-py` and `pandas`
2. **Aggregate** → Ward-level data rolled up to county totals by year
3. **Calculate** → Margins, percentages, and vote shares computed with third-party inclusion
4. **Validate** → Cross-referenced against official state totals
5. **Export** → Single JSON file (`wi_elections_aggregated.json`) consumed by map

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** (for data processing)
- **Java Runtime Environment** (for PDF extraction with tabula-py)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Text editor or IDE

### Installation

```powershell
# 1. Clone or download the project
cd WIRealignment

# 2. Create Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 3. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r script/requirements.txt

# 4. Install Java (if not already installed)
winget install Oracle.JavaRuntimeEnvironment
```

### Running the Map

**Option 1: Simple Python Server (Recommended)**
```powershell
cd script
python serve.py
```
Then open browser to `http://localhost:8000`

**Option 2: Direct File Open**
- Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
- Note: Some browsers may have CORS restrictions with local files

### Viewing the Visualization

2. **County Interaction**: Click any county to see detailed vote breakdown
3. **Sidebar Navigation**: Scroll through research findings for curated insights
4. **Color Legend**: Counties colored by margin strength (deep blue = strong D, deep red = strong R)

## 🔧 Data Processing Workflows

### Adding New Election Data

When new Wisconsin election results become available:

```powershell
cd script

# 1. Extract from PDF (if needed)
python extract_election_data.py

# 2. Aggregate into master JSON
python aggregate_elections.py

# 3. Add to existing JSON (preserves previous years)
python add_2024_data.py

# 4. Verify output
python check_senate.py  # Validates data integrity
```

### Updating Margin Calculations

If you need to recalculate margins (e.g., switch between two-party vs total-vote methodology):

```powershell
# Recalculate all margins to include third parties
python recalculate_margins_with_third_parties.py

# Generate updated research findings with new margins
python generate_research_findings.py
```

### Geographic Data Updates

If you need to update county boundaries or add new shapefiles:

```powershell
cd script

# Convert shapefile to GeoJSON
python convert_shapefile_to_geojson.py

# Output: data/tl_2020_55_county20.geojson
```

## 📖 Key Research Findings

### Milwaukee County - Urban Democratic Anchor
**Trend**: D+20.49% (2000) → D+38.41% (2024)  
Wisconsin's largest county has become increasingly Democratic, with margins expanding by 18 points over 24 years. Growth in minority populations and urban-core density drive this trend.

### WOW Counties - Suburban Moderation
**Waukesha, Ozaukee, Washington** - Traditional Republican strongholds showing Democratic gains:
- **Waukesha**: R+35.29% → R+19.69% (16pt D shift)
- **Ozaukee**: R+32.41% → R+10.45% (22pt D shift)
- **Washington**: R+40.58% → R+36.21% (4pt D shift)

College-educated suburban voters shifting left, though all remain Republican.

### Dane County - Progressive Acceleration
**Trend**: D+28.58% (2000) → D+51.53% (2024)  
Madison metro area (UW-Madison, state government, tech sector) showing explosive Democratic growth. Second-largest county by population, rapidly expanding margins offset Republican rural dominance.

### BOW Counties - Fox Valley Realignment
**Brown, Outagamie, Winnebago** - Working-class industrial counties that flipped sharply Republican:
- **Brown**: D+9.15% (2008) → R+10.73% (2016) = 20pt swing
- **Outagamie**: D+11.60% (2008) → R+12.57% (2016) = 24pt swing
- **Winnebago**: D+11.66% (2008) → R+7.34% (2016) = 19pt swing

### Driftless Area - The Obama-Trump Transformation
**Crawford, Grant, Lafayette, Richland, Vernon, Iowa** - Historic Democratic farming region with 30-43pt swings toward Republicans between 2008-2024. Some of America's most dramatic political realignment, driven by working-class white voters in rural areas.

**Note**: These 2024 examples show Wisconsin's political geography - urban/university counties (Dane, Milwaukee) strongly Democratic, suburban counties moderating (Waukesha from R+35% to R+20%), working-class counties (BOW) turned Republican, and rural counties (Driftless Area) showing massive rightward shifts.
